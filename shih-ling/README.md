# APSC 101 U-1 Arduino Code Repository

## Repository Management
Please only edit your own folder. Do not touch other people's items. If you're trying to push to the repository and GitHub tells you there is a conflict, DO NOT force commit. Please resolve the issue (most likely your version is not up-to-date) before pushing again. To update your branch, pull from the repo, then push.
### Best Practices:
Always pull and update your version before starting work. Once you're finished your work, push the commit to the repo.
