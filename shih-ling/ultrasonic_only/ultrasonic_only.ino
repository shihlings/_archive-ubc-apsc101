  Title:        APSC 101 U-1 Module 5 Arduino Program with Ultrasonic Sensor
  Author:       Shih-Ling Shen
  Date:         Jan 27th, 2023
  Description:  This program relies on the ultrasonic sensor to determine when to grab and release the object.
  Operation:    The claw closes if it reaches below the set distance threshold and the previous state of the claw was open
                The claw opens if it reaches below the set distance threshold and the previous state of the claw was closed

  #define INITIAL_ANGLE           105     //the initial angle the servo motor is at. The twist angle will be adjust accordingly to this number (in degrees)
  #define TWIST_ANGLE             -90    //the amount to twist to grasp the object (in degrees)
  #define PERFORMANCE_DELAY       30    //the time delay to wait between each data check
